# ParallelMatrixMultiplication
A short study of OpenMP and MPI by way of matrix multiplication. The examples are written in C++ and make use of the Vector class from the standard library. 

Until I transcribe it into markdown, report.pdf will be the main source of information on the project. Please give it a look.
